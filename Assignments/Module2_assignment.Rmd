### Presentation Outline

1. Find a data set of interest, i.e. data from DREAM, TCGA, GEO, etc.

2. Perform 3 feature selection / dimensionality reduction methods.

    a. Perform a filtering and wrapper method for feature selection to get Feature Matrix 1 and 2.
  
    b. Perform a dimensionality reduction method to get Feature Matrix 3.
  
    c. Implement your own `information.gain()` function and demonstrate that it produces the correct results on a small, toy data set.
  
3. Select an appropriate model and fit to each of the 3 feature matrices from Step 2.

4. Evaluate the performance of each of the feature set with appropriate metrics and visualizations.

Report your code and interpret your results in a .Rmd or PDF, which you will present in class 25 Feb 2016.
