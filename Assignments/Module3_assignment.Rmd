### Presentation Outline

1. Provide brief background on your data set, which can be the same or different than the one you used in Module 2. Explain your hypothesis / research question and how you plan to address it.

2. Perform one or more feature selection / dimensionality reduction methods that are appropriate for your data. Justify your choices.
  
3. Fit an appropriate Ridge regression model and a Lasso regression model.

4. Use cross-validation to learn the optimal lambda value in an elastic net regression model for different values of alpha.

5. Evaluate the performance of each model with appropriate metrics and visualizations.

Report your code and interpret your results in a .Rmd or PDF, which you will present in class March 17th.
